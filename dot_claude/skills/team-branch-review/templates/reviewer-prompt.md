## Process

### Step 1: Primary Review
1. Understand the branch:
   - Run `git log --oneline BASE_COMMIT..HEAD` to see commits
   - Run `git diff --stat BASE_COMMIT..HEAD` for scope
2. For each changed file relevant to your focus:
   - Read the diff: `git diff BASE_COMMIT..HEAD -- <filepath>`
   - Read surrounding context with the Read tool for the full picture
   - Trace dependencies and callers with Grep and Glob
   - For large files, read the entire file to understand how the change fits
3. Think deeply. Look for subtle issues, not just obvious ones. Consider interactions between changed files.
4. Collect ALL findings - report every issue you find, including ones you are uncertain about or consider low-severity. Do not filter for importance or confidence here; the Codex validation step (Step 2) is where findings get confirmed, refuted, and re-rated. Coverage is the goal at this stage - a finding that later gets filtered out is better than a real issue silently dropped. Tag each finding with a severity and confidence so the validation step can rank them.

### Step 2: Codex Validation

Validate your findings using the Codex MCP tool.

Call `mcp__codex__codex` with:
- `sandbox`: `"read-only"`
- `approval-policy`: `"never"`
- `cwd`: "CWD"

Use this prompt (substitute YOUR_FINDINGS with your actual findings from Step 1):

```
You are a senior code reviewer validating findings from a FOCUS_AREA specialist. Rigorously challenge each finding: confirm real issues, flag false positives, correct severity ratings, and catch anything missed within FOCUS_AREA.

## Planning Context

PLANNING_CONTEXT

Treat the planning context as the reference for intent. If a finding contradicts a design decision the author already made consciously, either drop it or flag it as a tradeoff the author should re-examine — do not restate the decision as a defect.

## Domain Expertise

Use this context to evaluate findings with the right lens:

## Your Task

### Part 1: Validate Each Finding

For EACH finding, examine the actual code yourself:
1. Run `git diff BASE_COMMIT..HEAD -- <file>` to see the change
2. Read surrounding context to understand the full picture
3. Apply the domain expertise above: does this finding reflect a real concern per those criteria?
4. Determine your verdict:

### Finding: [original title]
- **Verdict**: Confirmed | Disputed | Severity Adjusted | Enhanced
- **Confidence**: High | Medium | Low
- **Rationale**: Specific reasoning with code evidence for your verdict
- **Adjusted Severity**: [only if different from original]
- **Additional Context**: [related issues, broader implications, or missing nuance]

### Part 2: Find Missed Issues

After validating, check the same files for FOCUS_AREA issues the primary review missed. Use the domain expertise criteria above to guide what you look for.
Report new findings using the same format, prefixed with "NEW -".

### Part 3: Validation Summary

- Findings confirmed: N / total
- Findings disputed: N / total
- Severity adjustments: N
- New findings added: N
```

If the Codex MCP call fails, report your unvalidated findings and note that Codex validation was unavailable.

### Step 3: Write Findings to File

Write your complete results to `/tmp/RUN_ID/REVIEWER_NAME.md` using the Write tool. Use this exact format:

## Raw Findings

For each finding:

### [Short descriptive title]
- **File**: path/to/file:line_number
- **Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
- **Category**: [specific concern within FOCUS_AREA]
- **Issue**: Clear description of the problem
- **Evidence**: The specific code snippet or diff excerpt showing the issue
- **Suggestion**: Concrete fix or improvement
- **Confidence**: High | Medium | Low

## Codex Validation Results

[Full Codex validation output from Step 2]

## Summary
- Raw findings: Critical: N, High: N, Medium: N, Low: N
- After Codex validation: N confirmed, N disputed, N adjusted, N new

## Notable Observations
[Broader observations about patterns, quality, or concerns in your focus area]

After writing the findings file, your work is complete. Do not wait for further instructions, attempt additional analysis, or offer to help with other tasks.
