# Team Branch Review

Comprehensive code review of all commits on the current branch compared to main. Spawns a team of parallel Claude (Opus) reviewers - each specializing in a different review concern. Each reviewer independently validates their own findings using the Codex MCP, then the lead synthesizes the final report.

## Context

- Working directory: !`pwd`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Base commit: !`git merge-base HEAD origin/main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || echo "main"`

## Instructions

You are the team lead conducting a comprehensive multi-agent code review.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use TeamCreate to create an agent team and the Task tool (with team_name parameter) to spawn Claude reviewer agents. Each reviewer is an independent Claude agent session, NOT a Codex MCP call. Do NOT substitute direct mcp__codex__codex calls for agent teammates. The Codex MCP is used only BY the reviewer agents internally to validate their own findings - you (the lead) do not call Codex directly.**

**This skill does NOT edit files.** It produces a review report only.

You will:
1. Spawn a team of Claude (Opus) reviewer agents using TeamCreate and the Task tool
2. Each reviewer explores the code deeply and validates their findings with Codex MCP
3. You collect all validated findings and synthesize the final report

### Phase 0: Precondition Check

Before doing anything else, verify you have the required tools:

1. **Check for the Task tool (subagent spawner).** This is the tool that launches new agent sessions with parameters like `subagent_type`, `team_name`, `name`, `model`, and `prompt`. Look at your available tools - if you do not have a tool called "Task" that spawns subagents, STOP IMMEDIATELY and tell the user:

   "This skill requires the Task tool (subagent spawner) which is not available in custom agent sessions (claude --agent). Run this skill from a plain `claude` session instead."

   Do NOT attempt workarounds (CLI commands, direct Codex calls, single-agent review). Just stop.

2. **Check for the TeamCreate tool.** If not available, stop and tell the user:
   "Agent teams are required for this skill. Enable them by setting CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 in your Claude Code settings, then retry."

Do NOT proceed past this phase unless both tools are confirmed available.

### Phase 1: Analyze Branch Scope

Substitute BASE_COMMIT from Context above, then run these git commands:

```bash
git diff --shortstat BASE_COMMIT..HEAD
git log --oneline BASE_COMMIT..HEAD
git diff --stat BASE_COMMIT..HEAD
```

**Look up PR description** (if one exists for this branch):

```bash
gh pr view --json title,body --jq '"## " + .title + "\n\n" + .body' 2>/dev/null
```

If a PR exists, save the output as **pr_context**. If the command fails (no PR exists), set **pr_context** to empty string.

**Parse arguments and resolve epic**: Check if `$ARGUMENTS` begins with `--epic <EPIC_ID>`. If so, extract the ID and strip the flag (and its value) from the remaining arguments. Then follow `~/.claude/skills/shared/planning-context.md` to produce **planning_context** — the rendered block substituted into the reviewer prompt's `PLANNING_CONTEXT` placeholder. If no `--epic` was passed, that procedure falls back to parsing the branch name and finally to the "no linked planning context" string. Do not stop the pipeline if resolution fails — the fallback is valid output.

Record:
- **lines_changed**: Total lines added + removed
- **files_changed**: List of all changed file paths
- **commit_count**: Number of commits
- **base_commit**: The exact commit hash (use this everywhere, not "main")
- **pr_context**: The PR title and body if a PR exists, otherwise empty
- **planning_context**: The rendered block from the planning-context loader
- **team_name**: Compute a unique team name: take the branch name, replace `/` with `-`, truncate to 30 chars, then prefix with `review-` and append `-` plus the first 6 chars of HEAD's commit hash. Example: branch `feat/add-auth` at commit `a1b2c3d` becomes `review-feat-add-auth-a1b2c3`. Use this value everywhere a team_name is needed.

### Phase 2: Determine Team Composition

Based on lines_changed:

**Small (< 200 lines)** - 2 reviewers:

| Name | Focus |
|------|-------|
| `reviewer-security` | Security, correctness, logic errors, edge cases, input validation |
| `reviewer-pragmatism` | Architecture, code quality, unnecessary complexity, premature abstraction, YAGNI, over-engineering, locality of behavior |

**Medium (200-1000 lines)** - 4 reviewers:

| Name | Focus |
|------|-------|
| `reviewer-security` | Vulnerabilities, injection, auth gaps, input validation, data exposure |
| `reviewer-correctness` | Logic errors, off-by-one, nil dereferences, concurrency, edge cases |
| `reviewer-architecture` | Design patterns, abstraction, coupling, API design, modularity |
| `reviewer-simplicity` | Over-engineering, premature abstraction, YAGNI, unnecessary complexity, locality of behavior, Chesterton's Fence |

**Large (1000+ lines)** - 6 reviewers:

| Name | Focus |
|------|-------|
| `reviewer-security` | Vulnerabilities, injection, auth gaps, input validation, data exposure |
| `reviewer-correctness` | Logic errors, off-by-one, nil dereferences, race conditions |
| `reviewer-architecture` | Design patterns, coupling, API design, modularity |
| `reviewer-simplicity` | Over-engineering, premature abstraction, YAGNI, unnecessary complexity, locality of behavior, Chesterton's Fence |
| `reviewer-performance` | Allocations, N+1 queries, resource leaks, algorithmic complexity |
| `reviewer-testing` | Coverage gaps, testability, missing test cases, test quality |

### Phase 3: Spawn Team and Reviewer Agents

1. **Create the team**:
   ```
   TeamCreate(team_name: "TEAM_NAME", description: "Branch review of BRANCH_NAME")
   ```

2. **Create temp directory** for reviewer findings:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/review-TEAM_NAME
   ```

3. **Load templates and reviewer briefs.** Before spawning, read the following files using the Read tool:

   **Prompt templates** (from `~/.claude/skills/team-branch-review/templates/`):
   - `templates/reviewer-prompt.md` - The prompt template for reviewer agents (used in step 4 below)
   - `templates/final-report.md` - The report format for Phase 5 synthesis (read now, use later)

   **Reviewer briefs** (canonical source:
   `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/`). The staged files under
   `~/.claude/skills/shared/reviewers/` are pointers for migration review, not
   standalone fallbacks; install the shared files first.

   | Reviewer name | Brief file |
   |---|---|
   | `reviewer-security` | `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/security.md` |
   | `reviewer-correctness` | `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/correctness.md` |
   | `reviewer-architecture` | `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/architecture.md` |
   | `reviewer-simplicity` | `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/simplicity.md` |
   | `reviewer-pragmatism` | `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/pragmatism.md` |
   | `reviewer-performance` | `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/performance.md` |
   | `reviewer-testing` | `~/.config/dotfiles/agent-review/reviewers/testing.md` |

   Read ALL relevant brief files and both template files.

4. **Spawn ALL reviewers in parallel** (send all Task calls in a single message):

   For each reviewer, take the loaded reviewer prompt template and substitute all placeholders, then pass the result as the Task prompt:

   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     team_name: "TEAM_NAME",
     name: "reviewer-security",
     description: "Security review",
     prompt: "[reviewer-prompt.md with all placeholders substituted]"
   )
   ```

   Repeat for each reviewer. All spawns happen simultaneously.

### Reviewer Prompt Template

Each reviewer receives the prompt from `~/.claude/skills/team-branch-review/templates/reviewer-prompt.md` (loaded in Phase 3, step 3).

Substitute these placeholders before passing to each reviewer:

| Placeholder | Value |
|---|---|
| FOCUS_AREA | The reviewer's specialization name |
| FOCUS_DESCRIPTION | One-line description of their focus |
| FOCUS_BRIEF | Full content from the reviewer's brief file |
| BRANCH_NAME | Current branch name |
| BASE_COMMIT | Exact commit hash from Phase 1 |
| FILE_LIST | All changed file paths, one per line |
| CWD | Working directory |
| TEAM_NAME | The team name computed in Phase 1 (used for findings file path) |
| REVIEWER_NAME | The reviewer's name, e.g. `reviewer-security` (used for findings file path) |
| PR_CONTEXT | The PR title and body from pr_context if available, otherwise the literal string "No PR description available." |
| PLANNING_CONTEXT | The rendered planning_context block from Phase 1 (falls back to "No linked planning context available — reviewing against general code-quality heuristics only." when no epic resolved) |
| TEAM_ROSTER | List of all OTHER reviewers (omit current). Format each as: `- reviewer-name: Focus description` |

### Phase 4: Wait for All Reviewers to Complete

Wait for each reviewer to go idle (indicating they finished their work). Do NOT poll for findings files using bash loops with sleep - this violates the monitoring rule in `~/.claude/rules/monitoring.md`.

Teammates send idle notifications automatically when their turn ends. As each reviewer goes idle, check if their findings file exists at `/tmp/review-TEAM_NAME/{reviewer-name}.md`. Once all expected files exist, read each one and compile all findings into a single list tagged by reviewer.

If a reviewer goes idle but did not produce a findings file, note the gap in the final report and proceed with available findings.

### Phase 5: Synthesize Final Report

You (the lead) produce the final report directly using the findings read from `/tmp/review-TEAM_NAME/` files in Phase 4. Deduplicate findings caught by multiple reviewers (note cross-references). Resolve conflicts by favoring the position with stronger code evidence.

Use the report format from `~/.claude/skills/team-branch-review/templates/final-report.md` (loaded in Phase 3, step 3). Substitute BRANCH_NAME and fill in all sections with the compiled findings.

### Phase 6: Cleanup

1. **Shut down all reviewers**: Send a shutdown request to each reviewer agent:
   ```
   SendMessage(to: "reviewer-NAME", message: {type: "shutdown_request"})
   ```
   Send all shutdown requests in a single message (parallel). Then wait for the `teammate_terminated` system notifications before proceeding. Do NOT call TeamDelete until all agents have terminated.

2. `TeamDelete()` - clean up the agent team (only after all agents terminated)
3. `rm -rf /tmp/review-TEAM_NAME` - remove temp findings directory

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Recovery |
|----------|----------|
| Reviewer agent fails or times out | Note the gap in the report, continue with remaining findings |
| Codex MCP unavailable for a reviewer | Reviewer reports unvalidated findings, noted in report |
| Team spawn fails | Fall back to single-agent review (run codex-branch-review instead) |
| No findings from any reviewer | Report "APPROVED - no issues found" with note about review coverage |

## Guidelines

- **Model inheritance**: Do NOT set a `model` parameter on spawned agents - they inherit the global model setting automatically
- **Parallel execution**: Spawn ALL reviewer agents simultaneously in one message
- **Fixed base commit**: Use the exact hash from Phase 1 everywhere, never "main"
- **Distributed Codex validation**: Each reviewer calls Codex MCP to validate their own findings (runs in parallel)
- **Don't embed diffs in prompts**: Let agents and Codex gather diffs via git commands themselves
- **Deep exploration**: Reviewers should use Read, Grep, Glob extensively - not just skim diffs
- **No severity inflation**: Findings should use honest, appropriate severity levels
- **Phase 4 is a hard gate**: Do NOT write the report until all reviewer findings files exist. This is non-negotiable.
- **Findings come from files**: Reviewers write findings to `/tmp/review-TEAM_NAME/`. Do not use message content as findings.

## Next Steps

After presenting the report, if the outcome is NEEDS REVISION or MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED, add this note:

> **Next steps:**
> - `/team-branch-fix` - Implement fixes for these findings. Choose which to fix, then agents implement changes in parallel.
> - `/team-branch-comment` - Post findings as PR review comments on specific lines. Choose which findings to comment on, then comments are posted via GitHub API.
