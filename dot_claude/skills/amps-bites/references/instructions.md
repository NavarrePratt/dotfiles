# AMPS Bites Generator - Full Instructions

Generate a weekly status update for the Applied Training (AT) team by collecting GitHub and Slack activity and synthesizing it into concise bullets.

## Team Members

| Name | GitHub | Slack display name |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| Aaron Batilo | abatilo | abatilo |
| Navarre Pratt | NavarrePratt | npratt |

## Tracked Projects

Always check for updates on these projects. If there's meaningful progress, include a bullet. If nothing happened that week, skip it - don't force a mention.

| Project | What to look for |
|---------|-----------------|
| Aviato / CoreWeave Sandbox | Customer-facing name is "CoreWeave Sandbox". Repos: aviato, aviato-deploy, cwsandbox-client, kabinet-charts. Slack: #aviato is the best channel for project-level updates. Look for: feature work, customer onboarding, private preview milestones, docs updates |

## Output Format

The update is a short reply in the weekly AMPS Bites thread in #eng-amps-ext-staff. Format:

```
AT:
 Bullet one - concise summary of meaningful work
 Bullet two - another item
 Bullet three - etc
```

The audience is senior staff across AMPS - they want to know what moved the needle this week, not a changelog. Write like you're telling a coworker what happened over coffee. 3-5 bullets max.

Guidelines:
- Project-level milestones, not technical stats (no "merged 28 PRs")
- Plain language, no jargon-heavy PR titles
- Don't list everything - pick what matters
- Casual and direct, not promotional. This is not a promo packet.
- If a tracked project had progress, lead with it

## Procedure

### Step 1: Collect GitHub Activity

Use the `gh` CLI to pull PRs from the past 7 days for each team member across the coreweave org. Run these in parallel:

```bash
# Merged PRs - abatilo
gh search prs --author=abatilo --owner=coreweave --merged-at=">=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d)" --limit=50 --json title,repository,url,closedAt

# Merged PRs - NavarrePratt
gh search prs --author=NavarrePratt --owner=coreweave --merged-at=">=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d)" --limit=50 --json title,repository,url,closedAt

# Opened PRs (not yet merged) - abatilo
gh search prs --author=abatilo --owner=coreweave --created=">=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d)" --state=open --limit=30 --json title,repository,url,createdAt

# Opened PRs (not yet merged) - NavarrePratt
gh search prs --author=NavarrePratt --owner=coreweave --created=">=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d)" --state=open --limit=30 --json title,repository,url,createdAt
```

Note: macOS `date` uses `-v-7d` for 7 days ago. If that fails, try `date -d '7 days ago'` (GNU).

### Step 2: Collect Slack Activity

Use the Slack MCP tools. Run these searches in parallel:

**Per-person activity** (broad search across all channels):
- `mcp__slack__conversations_search_messages` with `filter_users_from` set to each user's display name (@abatilo, @npratt)
- Set `filter_date_after` to 7 days ago (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Limit to 20-30 messages per person

**Tracked project channels** (for project-level context the team may not have authored):
- Pull recent history from channels listed in the tracked projects table (e.g., #aviato)
- Use `mcp__slack__conversations_history` with limit of 1w
- This catches updates from other contributors, customer feedback, and decisions that inform the project bullet

Skim messages for themes: what projects are being discussed, what shipped, blockers, decisions. Ignore casual chatter and short replies - focus on substantive messages about work.

### Step 3: Synthesize

Start with the tracked projects table - check if any had meaningful progress this week. Then look at the rest of the activity for anything else worth mentioning.

Think at the project level: what milestones were hit, what's now possible that wasn't before, what moved forward in a way that matters. Group related PRs and Slack threads into a single narrative bullet. 3-5 bullets max.

Good bullet: "Aviato rename to CoreWeave Sandbox is done - client, docs, and charts all updated"
Bad bullet: "Merged 28 PRs across cwsandbox-client, aviato, ark, actions, docs, kabinet-charts"

Do NOT include:
- PR counts or technical stats
- Raw PR titles or commit messages
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, dependency bumps)
- Work that hasn't meaningfully progressed
- Anything that reads like a promo packet or changelog

### Step 4: Present Draft

Present two sections. The first is the actual update ready to post. The second is a reference section with the raw activity so the user can jog their memory and tweak the draft.

```
## Draft

AT:
 [bullet 1]
 [bullet 2]
 ...

## Activity Reference

**[Team member name]**
PRs merged:
- [PR title] (repo) - [url]
- ...

PRs open:
- [PR title] (repo) - [url]
- ...

Slack highlights:
- [channel] - [brief summary of substantive message]
- ...

**[Next team member]**
...
```

The draft is ready to copy-paste into Slack. The activity reference is just for the user to scan and decide if anything was missed or mischaracterized. Ask if they want to adjust anything.
